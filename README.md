# Ziran Language for VS Code

Editor support for Ziran `.zi` source: syntax highlighting, brackets, comments,
import completion, and Go to Definition for extensionless `#import "module"`
statements. Modules are discovered from `.zi` and `.zir` files in the open
workspace. The extension also finds the standard modules in a sibling `ziran/std`
directory, so a Kryon workspace can import them without listing every module.
This is language support for any Ziran project; it does not bundle Kryon widgets.

For module directories outside the workspace, set `ziran.modulePaths` in VS Code
settings. Paths may be absolute or relative to the workspace folder. The
compiler still needs the corresponding `--module-path` arguments when building.
If several files have the same module name, Go to Definition offers every match.

## Install

Download the `.vsix` from the [latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/kryonlabs/kryon-vscode/releases/latest), then run:

```sh
code --install-extension ziran-language-*.vsix
```

You can also use **Extensions: Install from VSIX...** in VS Code. Reload the
window after installing. New `.zi` tabs will open in Ziran mode automatically.
If an existing tab still says Plain Text in the status bar, use **Change Language
Mode** and select **Ziran**.

## Build

```sh
npm ci
npm test
npm run package
```

GitHub Actions uploads a VSIX from every build. Maintainers can use the
workflow's **Run workflow** button with **Publish GitHub Release** enabled to
publish the package version as a public release.
